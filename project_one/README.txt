MuralFind

Is a website created to help people appreciate and be able to find street art and murals.

Many people are interested in finding out where these are located and through an interactive map they can see the locations.

The goal of the page is to inform and share knowledge about street art because it is often an important way to 
tell the history of a city and town. 


Street art is also important through its social and political message it carries and many times finding the location of that art or information is  difficult.

The goal is to make this information accessible to others.
